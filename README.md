## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Structure the HTML form from the desktop and start with the mobile first approach.

### Continued development

I really want to understand how to make the best CSS structure and naming in combination
with the HTML structuring and class naming that will enable me to extend it to large project.
From what i see we can make small projects with simple CSS and it workds fine but as the project get bigger and bigger managing css will become issue.

### Useful resources
